<p>Welcome to the Falls Creek Ranch (FCR) website! FCR is a unique community of 940 acres of forests and meadows almost completely surrounded by the San Juan National Forest. It is located in a beautiful hidden valley northwest of Durango and has expansive views of the Animas Valley and the Red Cliffs. Since FCR's creation in the 1970s, our vision has been to 'live naturally with nature'.</p>

FCR is unique because of the way it is structured. Each member owns a one- acre parcel, and the remaining 840 acres is common property. This ‘common property’ approach provides a natural environment enjoyed by members in a variety of ways. The community is overseen by a volunteer Board of Directors and several committees, which manage the various operational aspects of the Ranch. We are like a small village, with our own water supply and distribution system, and several miles of roads which we maintain with our own equipment. Many of our members volunteer their time to help work on various ranch committees and projects; it is this sense of a community working together that makes living at Falls Creek Ranch so special.

Our numerous amenities allow members many recreational opportunities.  FCR's 840 acres of common property includes:  our private lake, a tennis/pickleball court, horse facilities, trails for walking and bicycling, beautiful views and wildlife/bird watching.

Our [Board of Directors](/contact-us/) and [Committees](/committees/) manage the HOA in accordance with our protective covenants and specific rules. Our annual assessments pay for the water system, road maintenance, common property management, centralized trash collection, our full-time on-site employee, and all the other aspects of managing a small community.

It is truly a special place to live!
