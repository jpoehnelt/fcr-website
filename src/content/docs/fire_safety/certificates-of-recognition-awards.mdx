## Other Firewise Awards/Recognition

**Press Release from Wildfire Adapted Partnership - January 2019**

**Paulette Church of Falls Creek Ranch Receives 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Award**

The Wildfire Mitigation Awards committee has announced the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Award winners, and Wildfire Adapted Partnership is pleased to announce that Paulette Church of Falls Creek Ranch in Durango is one of seven national winners.

Established in 2014, the Wildfire Mitigation Awards are co-sponsored by the National Association of State Foresters (NASF), the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the USDA Forest Service (USFS). These awards help demonstrate the tremendous societal value that wildfire mitigation efforts provide. By honoring their achievements, the award sponsors seek to increase public recognition and awareness of the value of wildfire mitigation.

Wildfire Adapted Partnership nominated Paulette Church for her dedication to reducing the wildfire risk of her community. Paulette has served as the Falls Creek Ranch Wildfire Adapted Neighborhood Ambassador since March 2016. During this time, she has focused on safety and increasing capacity by purchasing equipment so that residents can do much of the mitigation work themselves. She has also organized work crews to fell large trees on over 30 acres of common property within Falls Creek, as well as community-wide workdays and an annual Christmas tree-cutting day to thin out numerous small white firs.

“Paulette’s leadership has been the driving force behind many community efforts that are uncharacteristic of other neighborhood associations in our area and truly characterizes the type of out-of-the-box approach that has made Falls Creek’s efforts so successful,” said Chief Hal Doughty of the Durango Fire Protection District. “As a result of all of the preparation and hard work done in the Falls Creek area, that subdivision wound up being the pivotal turning point in stopping the southward progression of the 416 Fire this year."
