## Billing Process

The water billing process is a contracted service managed by Pioneer Energy Management (PEM). They will read the meters each month and prepare bills for all lots and the Corral. Members may pay PEM by paper check, credit card (extra fee) or ECheck/ACH. Late fees will apply. Failure to pay could subject Members to the FCR Collections Policy. The Board Treasurer will conduct on-going oversight of the PEM Contract, payment receipts and deposits.
