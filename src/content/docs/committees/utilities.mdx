This committee manages, maintains, and operates the Ranchâ€™s potable water system in conjunction with our state-certified Operator in Responsible Charge (ORC).

Its responsibilities include ensuring compliance with all state and public health regulations for water sampling, testing, and reporting. The committee also manages water meter readings and billing, maintains the water system infrastructure, and handles long-term water supply planning.

## Billing Process

Water billing is managed by a contracted service, Pioneer Energy Management (PEM). PEM reads the meters monthly and prepares bills for all lots and the Corral. Members can pay by paper check, credit card (with an extra fee), or ECheck/ACH. Late fees will apply, and failure to pay may be subject to the FCR Collections Policy. The Board Treasurer oversees the PEM contract, payments, and deposits.
