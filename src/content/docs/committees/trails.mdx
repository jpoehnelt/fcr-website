## Mission

Welcome to the Falls Creek Ranch trails! We invite all residents to explore and enjoy our beautiful trail network.

> **Get Involved:** To volunteer or join our planning efforts, please email Justin at:

## Trespassing & Enforcement

Please remember that these trails are private property for the **exclusive use of residents and their guests**. We strictly enforce property boundaries using cameras. **Violations will be reported to the La Plata County Sheriff.**

## Trail Guidelines

We need your help to keep our trails safe and in good shape. This is especially important in Spring and Fall when the ground freezes and thaws, making the soil soft.

### Seasonal Closures: The "Sink" Rule

**The Golden Rule:** If your tires, boots, or hooves sink more than **1 inch**, the trail is too wet. Please turn around.

*   **Best Time to Go:** Early morning or late evening when the ground is frozen solid.
*   **When to Avoid:** Midday when the sun melts the top layer into "peanut butter" mud.

**Why it Matters:** Riding or walking on mud ruins the trail. It creates ruts that trap water, causing erosion and tripping hazards.

### Building Better Trails (Modern Design)

We are upgrading to machine-built trails. These are wider, drier, and last longer.

*   **The Half Rule:** We design trails so they aren't too steep. This helps water flow off the side naturally instead of running down the path.
*   **Full Bench (Solid Ground):** We use an excavator to cut a wide shelf (36+ inches) into the hill. This is called a "full bench." It means you are walking on solid earth, not loose dirt packed on the edge.
*   **Rolling Dips:** Instead of waterbars that can trip you, we use "rolling dips"—gentle dirt mounds that guide water off the trail.

**Visual Impact:** New trails might look "raw" at first. Please give them a few seasons for the grass to grow back and blend in.

### Equestrian Safety

Some of our older trails are narrow and built differently than the new ones.

*   **Ride on the Uphill Side:** Always guide your horse to the uphill (inside) part of the trail where the ground is solid.
*   **Avoid the Edge:** The outer edge can be soft and unstable, especially when wet.
*   **New Trails:** Even on new trails, please allow **1-2 seasons** for the dirt to fully harden before riding when it's damp.
