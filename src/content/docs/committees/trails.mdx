## Mission

Falls Creek Ranch trails and amenities are private property for the exclusive use of residents and their accompanied guests. The Association strictly enforces property boundaries. Trespassers will be prosecuted under C.R.S. 18-4-504. Camera surveillance and patrols are in use.

This group oversees the trails on Falls Creek Ranch according to the approved [Trails Plan 2023](/uploads/documents/trails_plan_2023.pdf).

To volunteer for trail work or to get involved in planning, please email the committee at [trails@fallscreekranch.org](mailto:trails@fallscreekranch.org).
