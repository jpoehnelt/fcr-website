Falls Creek Ranch has several committees that help manage our operations and amenities. Participation from our members is both valued and encouraged. Joining a committee is a great way to contribute to our community, share ideas, and meet your neighbors.

The Board of Directors establishes and maintains all committees (except for the Architectural Control Committee) and appoints their chairs. If you're interested in joining, please contact the committee chair directly to share your interest and any relevant experience.

## Other Groups

### Ranch Liaison

This position supervises our Ranch Caretaker and serves as the primary contact between the Board, committees, and residents on matters involving the Caretaker's duties. Residents are asked to go through the liaison rather than contacting the Ranch Caretaker directly.

### Records Management

This team collects, organizes, and files Ranch documents and records, ensuring compliance with state law for homeowner associations.
