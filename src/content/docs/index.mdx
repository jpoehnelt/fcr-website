## About Us

Welcome to Falls Creek Ranch (FCR)! We are a unique community of 940 acres of forests and meadows, almost completely surrounded by the San Juan National Forest. Located in a beautiful hidden valley northwest of Durango, FCR has expansive views of the Animas Valley and the Red Cliffs. Since our creation in the 1970s, our vision has been to "live naturally with nature."

FCR is unique in its structure. Each member owns a one-acre parcel, and the remaining 840 acres are common property. This approach provides a natural environment that members can enjoy in a variety of ways. The community is overseen by a volunteer Board of Directors and several committees, which manage the various operational aspects of the Ranch. We are like a small village, with our own water supply, distribution system, and several miles of roads that we maintain with our own equipment. Many of our members volunteer their time to help with committees and projects, and it is this sense of community that makes living at Falls Creek Ranch so special.

## Amenities

Our numerous amenities allow members many recreational opportunities. FCR's 840 acres of common property include:

- Our private lake
- A tennis/pickleball court
- Horse facilities
- Miles of trails
- Beautiful views and wildlife/bird watching

Our [Board of Directors](/contact-us/) and [Committees](/committees/) manage the HOA in accordance with our protective covenants and specific rules. Our annual assessments pay for the water system, road maintenance, common property management, centralized trash collection, and all the other aspects of managing a small community.

It is truly a special place to live!
