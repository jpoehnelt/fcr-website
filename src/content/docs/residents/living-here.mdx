## Welcome

Welcome to Falls Creek Ranch! Living at Falls Creek Ranch (FCR) is a special experience. FCR is a unique community that relies on a strong commitment from member volunteers to help manage our operations and amenities. We have a variety of committees that report to our Board of Directors (BOD); these committees manage our 840 acres of common property, amenities, and fire mitigation efforts and ensure compliance with our Covenants and committee rules. Member volunteerism and participation on committees or short-term projects is both valued and encouraged. It is a great way to contribute to our community, share ideas, and meet your neighbors.

All committees, other than the Architectural Control Committee, are established and maintained at the discretion of the Board of Directors. To join a committee, members are encouraged to contact the committee chair directly to share your interest and any relevant experience. See our [Committees page](/committees) for more details.

We have a full-time Ranch Caretaker whose responsibilities include our water system management and road maintenance. All other common property management is conducted by our member volunteers and some seasonal workers or contractors.

Our Board of Directors typically meets monthly, and all members are welcome to attend. Board member names and contact information are found on our [Contact Us page](/contact-us).

## New Residents

Our Welcome Committee contacts new residents via email with basic information and then schedules a personal meeting to deliver vehicle decals, guest tags, a member directory, a fire route map, and other helpful information.

## Vehicle Decals and Guest Vehicle Hang Tags

Per our Road Committee rules, residents’ vehicles must display an official FCR parking sticker on the lower driver's side of the front windshield. (Please remove it if you sell your vehicle). Guest vehicles must display either a yellow (day pass) or a green (house-guest) hangtag when parked anywhere on Common Property. Unmarked vehicles may be towed.

## Speed Limits

Please observe posted speed limits. The speed limit on the Ranch is 15 mph, except on Falls Creek Main from the entrance north to Oakcrest Drive, where it is 25 mph. Keeping a low speed helps minimize dust, maintain our gravel roads, and increase safety. Watch for wildlife, cyclists, pedestrians, and pets. Homeowners are responsible for informing guests and contractors to comply with our speed limits.

## Mailbox and Newspaper Tubes

Our USPS mailboxes are located near the entrance at the lake parking area. Mailboxes are assigned by address by FCR and the US Postal Service. New residents should obtain their mailbox key and number from the previous resident. If this is not possible, contact the Board President. Note that Federal Express and UPS usually deliver packages to your home.

Newspaper tubes are provided for delivery and are also used for internal communication, so be sure to check yours regularly. The tubes are labeled by members' last names and are managed by our Welcome Committee. Parcel boxes are also located behind the newspaper tubes.

## Trash/Dumpsters

The dumpsters are located near the entrance, south of the Fire Station. The brown dumpsters are for trash/garbage and have bear-proof locking access. Always secure the dumpster lids, and never leave trash or items next to them. The back doors must also be kept closed.

The blue dumpsters are for single-stream recycling. Please separate your trash from recyclables. See [recyclable item guidelines](https://www.durangogov.org/675/Single-Stream-MixedRecycling).

Note: The following items are not allowed in our trash or recycling dumpsters: glass containers, batteries, light bulbs, electronics, paints, and other household hazardous waste substances. The Durango Recycling Center accepts these items. See details [here](https://www.durangogov.org/710/Durango-Recycling-Center).

## Fire Emergency and Safety

It is very important for all members to be fire-aware and safe in our forest environment. FCR has a long history of fire prevention and mitigation efforts to help protect our property. A map of the Ranch is provided to all members by the Welcome Committee or the Firewise Ambassador, which shows the emergency fire exit route, "safe" meadow zones, and fire hydrants. FCR is a recognized "Firewise Community" and maintains a proactive fire mitigation environment. A lot of great information for home protection, fire safety, and local and national fire education resources can be found on our [Fire and Safety page](/fire_safety).

Additionally, FCR member volunteers comprise a Rapid Response Team ready to respond to fire emergencies on the Ranch. These volunteers have participated in specific wildland firefighting training and have been provided with equipment and supplies to support their efforts. Several residents also serve as CPR/AED-certified responders for medical emergencies. They have current first aid training and are trained in the operation of our AEDs. Please call 911, and they will contact our volunteers to provide assistance until professional first responders are on the scene, which can take up to 45 minutes.

All FCR members should register with the La Plata County CodeRed system for notifications of emergency conditions in our area. [Register for CodeRed](https://public.coderedweb.com/CNE/enUS/BFEA18547A8D).

## Water Supply

FCR has a community water system that provides our association’s potable water. The system includes wells, storage tanks, chlorine disinfection facilities, pumps, and piping, which complies with all state drinking water regulations. We have a billing system that charges property owners a monthly base service fee and a monthly usage fee. For more information, see the [Utilities Committee page](/committees/utilities).

Potable water is a valuable resource, particularly in high-desert mountain environments like ours. Water conservation is expected from all members. Conservation tips are provided in the Utilities Committee documents at the link above. Irrigation water is available from our lake via a pump, which members may use to fill their own or shared water tanks for home irrigation.

## Common Property Amenities

FCR is fortunate to have several amenities for the exclusive enjoyment of its members and their guests. Our 40-acre lake (Turner Reservoir) is one of our greatest assets and is fed by Falls Creek, which originates in the mountains above the Ranch. Year-round use of the lake is managed by our [Lake Committee](/committees/lake) and includes swimming, fishing, non-motorized boating, paddle-boarding, ice-skating, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and relaxing on the beach.

Other amenities include our entrance gardens, community orchard, member vegetable garden, tennis/pickleball court, picnic area, and hiking and bicycling trails. For more information on these activities, see the [Common Property Committee page](/committees/common-property).

## Horse Stables and Pastures

Horses are welcome at Falls Creek Ranch. A portion of our Common Property has been set aside to stable and pasture a limited number of horses. Horse owners are responsible for maintaining their own animals and the facilities and grounds allocated for this activity. The [Horse Committee](/committees/horse) oversees the management of the stables, pastures, and grazing conditions according to its Board-approved rules and regulations.

## Weed Control

FCR is required by the State of Colorado to control undesirable plants and noxious weeds on our property. We have an ongoing program managed by the Common Property Committee in collaboration with the La Plata County Weeds office, which administers the program for the state. Our program complies with state requirements to control weeds and maintain the beauty of our property. We appreciate all members helping to control such weeds on their private property and on common property.

## Trails

Falls Creek Ranch members can walk out their front doors into beautiful open meadows and wooded trails that traverse the Ranch Common Property. National Forest lands adjoin our Ranch on three sides, affording even more opportunities for walking, hiking, birdwatching, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and bicycling in a natural setting. Trails range from easy walking paths to longer, steeper trails leading to waterfalls, mountain views, meadows, aspen forests, and, in spring, wildflowers.

## Walking in High Meadows

FCR and High Meadows Ranch (HMR), our neighbors to the north, have a legal agreement that allows for reciprocal use of our properties for non-motorized recreation. This includes skiing and snowshoeing in their open meadows—away from the sight of homes to protect privacy—and walking in designated areas. FCR members may walk on the HMR main road north to the two-track dirt trail that leads northwest into Tripp Gulch and Forest Service land, and northeast to the HMR fire exit road into Forest Service land.

If there are locked gates in these areas, we may go through, over, or around them, as long as we stay on the designated road/trail (and are careful not to damage fencing). We may also walk the trail along the east ridge through Forest Service land but are not to cross through HMR resident lots or on their driveways back to the road. We can access the east ridge Forest Service land from the end of Oakcrest, by walking through our north meadow up the hill to the east (staying on FCR property), or by walking up the HMR road to their fire exit road.

Dogs must be kept leashed or directly under voice or electronic control, per La Plata County regulations. As good neighbors, we ask that all FCR residents abide by and respect our agreement with HMR. Here is a [summary of the joint agreement with HMR](/uploads/2016/03/FCR-and-High-Meadows-Agreement-and-Summary-of-Agreement-1988.pdf).

## Pets and Wildlife

Falls Creek Ranch offers many opportunities for wildlife watching. It is not unusual to see a mother bear with her cubs munching on acorns and wild berries, deer roaming the area eating garden flowers, turkeys gobbling, bobcats searching for a meal, a coyote walking through a meadow, or even an occasional mountain lion tracking a wintering elk.

FCR Covenants require pets to be kept within the owner’s lot or under direct control (voice, leash, or electronic) at all times when on common property, so as not to harass or harm wildlife. Pets are not permitted to run at large or become a nuisance.

## Living with Bears

Bears are commonly seen in Falls Creek Ranch. They typically emerge from their dens in late March or early April to search for food. Females with new cubs usually stay near their den until mid-to-late May, when the cubs are big enough to travel. Yearlings leaving their mothers are very curious and will get into anything looking for food.

It is our responsibility to keep bears from getting into trouble. Below is some information to help us live peacefully together:

1.  Our brown trash dumpsters have bear-proof lids. If you have trouble opening them, there is a sliding door in the back of each for easier access. Always keep the lids and doors closed. If the dumpsters are full, please take your trash home and bring it back another day.
2.  Do not leave bird seed in accessible feeders. This is the first thing bears will go after. Ideally, avoid feeding birds seed in the summer; they prefer insects and flower nectar. If you have hummingbird feeders, bring them inside at night and when you are away.
3.  Do not leave trash cans or garbage bags outside. Even if empty, they give off a smell, and bears will tear them open, leaving a mess.
4.  Do not leave garage doors open, especially if you have pet food or a refrigerator inside. Bears know how to open refrigerators.
5.  Close all windows and doors when you leave your home, especially on the ground floor. A bear can easily climb two or three stories.
6.  Do not leave BBQs outside unless they are clean. Burn them off after each use so the smell does not attract bears.
7.  Do not leave food or garbage in your vehicle. Park cars in a locked garage if possible. Otherwise, be sure all food (even gum) is out of the car, the windows are up, and the car is locked.
8.  Bears love to sit in hot tubs. Keep them covered and locked.
9.  Keep your dog under control or leashed at all times. Dogs will naturally chase bears, and a mother bear with cubs will not be friendly to your dog or you.
10. Do not make bears feel welcome. Do them a favor and chase them away. Shout, make noise, ring a bell, bang a pan, or throw rocks to scare them off. Do not let them feel comfortable around a residence or vehicle.
11. Enjoy them, but at a safe distance. This is their home, too.

Bears generally do not want to be near people or dogs. However, if a bear is not afraid of people, is breaking into houses or garages, or shows signs of aggression, contact [Colorado Parks and Wildlife](https://cpw.state.co.us/bears) for advice. Another good resource is [BearSmart Durango](http://bearsmartdurango.org/).
