Residents of Falls Creek Ranch generously volunteer their time and expertise to support the protection and safety of our members, property, and the surrounding forest. Volunteers are highly valued and appreciated.

Our volunteer services include residents trained in CPR and AED use for medical emergencies. Several AED stations are located within our property, and our response team is activated via a dedicated Ranch phone communication service **after** 911 is called.

Some residents also serve as part of our Rapid Response Team, which is ready to respond to fire emergencies on the Ranch. This team has received specific training from the Durango Fire Protection District and has been provided with equipment and supplies to assist in their efforts. We also have several hand-held radios assigned to specific resident volunteers to provide emergency communication at various locations on our property.

All members are encouraged to participate in our many workdays for fire mitigation and common property clean-up. All volunteer hours for fire mitigation projects on both common and private property should be recorded on the [Firewise Volunteer Hours form](#forms) and submitted to our Ranch Firewise Ambassador. These volunteer hours are used as part of our in-kind match to obtain grant funding for our many fire mitigation projects.

This information is provided to our members at our annual Firewise Education Day each spring. Our Firewise Ambassador and the [Firewise Committee](/committees/firewise) are available to provide advice and answer any questions about our community's fire safety efforts.
