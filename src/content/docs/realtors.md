## FAQ

### How much are current annual HOA dues, and what time period do they cover?

Annual HOA dues (excluding monthly water usage billings) are assessed annually and cover the fiscal year from
August 1 to July 31:

- Developed lots: $3,300
- Undeveloped lots: $3,200

### Is there a transfer fee?

Yes. Currently the fee is $50 as referenced in the attached Property Transfer Form. Please
have the Property Transfer Form executed by Buyer(s) during closing and mail, along with
transfer fee, to: 

<pre>
Falls Creek Ranch Association, Inc., 
C/O Treasurer
6350 Falls Creek Main
Durango, CO 81301
</pre>

### Are there any pending or current special assessments?

None at this time

### Is there anything else that needs to be collected and/or prorated?

Water Usage billing charges are separate from HOA dues and are calculated monthly, based
on water meter readings (water usage), and billed on the 10th of each month. We generally
donâ€™t collect the final water billing statement from the sellers through the closing. We will do a
manual meter reading on the date of close, and send the final water bill directly to the Sellers.
The buyers will receive their first billing on the 10th of the month following close date when the
meters are next read.
