### Are realtor signs allowed?

A professional realtor sign may be installed on the owner's lot while a home is for sale. For an open house, you may place signage on our common property for no more than 24 hours. See the [Architectural Control Committee documents](/committees/architectural-control#documents) for more information.

### Is there anything else that needs to be collected or prorated?

Water charges (base fee + usage fee) are separate from HOA dues and are billed monthly based on meter readings. We will perform a meter reading on the date of closing and send the final water bill directly to the sellers. The buyers will receive their first water invoice during the next billing period which ends on the 10th of each month.
