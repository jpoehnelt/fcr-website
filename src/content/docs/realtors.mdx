## FAQ

### Are realtor signs allowed?

A professional realtor sign may be installed on the owner's lot while a home is for sale. For an open house, you may place signage on our common property for no more than 24 hours. See the [Architectural Control Committee documents](/committees/architectural-control#documents) for more information.

### What are the current annual HOA dues?

Annual HOA dues cover the fiscal year from August 1 to July 31 and are separate from monthly water usage billings.

-   **Developed lots:** $3,300
-   **Undeveloped lots:** $3,200

### Is there a transfer fee?

Yes, the transfer fee is $50. Please have the Property Transfer Form executed by the buyer(s) during closing and mail it with the fee to:

Falls Creek Ranch Association, Inc.
c/o Treasurer
6350 Falls Creek Main
Durango, CO 81301

### Are there any pending or current special assessments?

None at this time.

### Is there anything else that needs to be collected or prorated?

Water usage charges are separate from HOA dues and are billed monthly based on meter readings. We will perform a manual meter reading on the date of closing and send the final water bill directly to the sellers. The buyers will receive their first billing on the 10th of the month following the closing date.
